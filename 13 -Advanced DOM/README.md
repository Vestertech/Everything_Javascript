DOM Manipulation and JavaScript Topics:

1. Selecting, Creating, and Deleting Elements:

   Use document.querySelector to select elements.
   Create elements with document.createElement.
   Delete elements using remove() or parentNode.removeChild().

2. Styles, Attributes, and Classes in DOM Manipulation:

   Modify styles with element.style.property.
   Access and modify attributes with element.getAttribute and element.setAttribute.
   Add, remove, or toggle classes with element.classList.

3. Implementing Smooth Scrolling:

   Use scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' }) for smooth scrolling.

4. Type of Events and Event Handlers:

   Various types of events include click, submit, keydown, etc.
   Attach event handlers with addEventListener.

5. Event Propagation, Bubbling, and Capturing:

   Events propagate through the DOM in a capturing phase, target phase, and bubbling phase.
   Use e.stopPropagation() to stop event propagation.

6. Event Delegation:
   Delegate events to a common parent element to improve performance.
   Handle events on child elements through the parent.
7. Page Navigation using DOM Manipulation:

   Utilize event delegation for page navigation.
   Use scrollIntoView to navigate to the selected section.

8. DOM Traversing:

   Traverse the DOM using parent, child, and sibling methods.

9. Lazy Loading Images:

   Use the Intersection Observer API to lazily load images.

10. Slider Component in DOM Manipulation:

    Create a basic slider component with navigation buttons.

11. Lifecycle DOM Events:

    Events like DOMContentLoaded, load, beforeunload, and unload represent different stages of the DOM lifecycle.

12. Efficient Script Loading - defer and async:

    Use defer to execute scripts after parsing but before DOMContentLoaded.
    Use async for independent scripts that can run concurrently.
